###Functionality

Payee Contact information is displayed in each card. An alert is displayed for payees with outdated credit card information.

To ***search for a payee***, simply begin typing into the search field and the app will dynamically filter your results. Clear the search field by deleting your input or clicking the small 'x' in the text field. 

To ***toggle sorting asceding or descending***, click the sort button near the top right of the window. 

For ***credit card*** information, click the expand button on the bottom-right corner of the card. 

To view ***invoices*** click the 'Details' button on the top right of the card. A modal will appear with each invoice's details, with descriptions hidden under the expand button. Simply click anywhere outside of the modal to dismiss it.
